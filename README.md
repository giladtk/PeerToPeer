# PeerToPeer Project
# Creating Investment Strategies with Machine Learning

In this project, we focus on creating investment strategies by leveraging machine learning models to help us choose the best loans in a data-driven manner. The process involves extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) procedures, as our data required numerous fixes to be usable.

# Highlights

Machine Learning: several models such as Linear regression, ADA-boost , random forest and more... Classification and Regression ( predicting realised return )
EDA: Comprehensive analysis to understand data distribution and identify patterns.
ETL: Rigorous data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for modeling.

The accompanying files document our entire process, including insights, evaluations, and tuning procedures conducted to enhance performance.

The Final resaults up to 50% lift for the grading system ROI-

EDA was mainly about Understandings For each feature and/or combination of featurs interaction with our target variable-

The Goal of the project was to "beat" the Original Grading system PeerToPeer uses-
